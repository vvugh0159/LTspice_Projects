1) The models are primarily designed for LT spice IV and for LT spice XVII 64 bits

2) all symbols have been created for each subcircuit.They can be found in the directory toogether with the .lib file.

3) A simulation file (simulation_LT_therm_Vishay.asc and the plot files)is joined in this archive where the user can reproduce some simulations presented in the Vishay technical note.

4) tolerances of the electrical characteristics of components:

the tolerances are modelled according to Monte Carlo distribution via the following parameters

The default value is 0 (nominal curve) and they can be fixed by the user as follows according to data sheet preferentially.

NTC Thermistor
**************
TR = tolerance on R25  can be set at 1,2,3 or 5 (standing for +/- 1,2,3 or 5%)
TB = tolerance on B25/85 can be set at 0.5 ,0.75 ,1,3  (standing for +/- 0.5 , 0.75,1 ,3 %)

TFPT RTD 
********
TOLR25 = tolerance on R25 can be set at 0.5 ,1 or 5 (standing for +/- 0.5, 1 or 5  %)
TOLSLOPE = 0 or 1 (for TOLSLOPE= 1 : the whole temperature coefficient uncertainty will be covered /for TOLSLOPE = 0 : the tolerance of the slope is set at 0)

PTS Platinum 
************
TOL0 is expressed in °C and TOLS in °C/°C

TOL0 = 0.3 must be coupled with TOLS= 0.005  

or 

TOL0 = 0.6 must be coupled TolS = 0.01
